I have made  a web application about Pokemons in which was used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The JavaScript loads up an external API and enables to viewing of details(such as: name, height, type and weight)
through a modal. At first I did not use bootstrap to make the layout,but then I used bootstrap for UI purposes
and realized the advantages of bootstrap
